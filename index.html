    <h2>Backtracking</h2>

    <p>
        <font color="#858585">Backtracking is a form of recursion <br /><br />
            The usual scenario is that you are faced with a number of options, and you must choose one of these. After
            you make your choice you will get a new set of options; just what set of options you get depends on what
            choice you made. This procedure is repeated over and over until you reach a final state. If you made a good
            sequence of choices, your final state is a goal state; if you didn't, it isn' <br /><br /> Conceptually, you
            start at the root of a tree; the tree probably has some good leaves and some bad leaves, though it may be
            that the leaves are all good or all bad. You want to get to a good leaf. At each node, beginning with the
            root, you choose one of its children to move to, and you keep this up until you get to a leaf.
            <br /><br />Suppose you get to a bad leaf. You can backtrack to continue the search for a good leaf by
            revoking your most recent choice, and trying out the next option in that set of options. If you run out of
            options, revoke the choice that got you here, and try another choice at that node. If you end up at the root
            with no options left, there are no good leaves to be </font>

                        but usually we don't have a data structure to tell us what choices we have. (If we do have an
                        actual tree data structure, backtracking on it is called depth-first tree searching.)</font>

                        solution--that is, node n is one of the nodes on a path from the root to some goal node. We say
                        that n is solvable. If solve(n) is false, then there is no path that includes n to any goal

    <h3>Non-recursive backtracking, using a stack</h3>
    <p>
        <font color="#858585">Backtracking is a rather typical recursive algorithm, and any recursive algorithm can be
            rewritten as a stack algorithm. In fact, <br /> that is how your recursive algorithms are translated into
            machine or assembly language.</font>

                  boolean solve(Node n) {
                  put node n on the stack;
                  while the stack is not empty {  
                   if the node at the top of the stack is a leaf {
                   if it is a goal node, return true
                     else pop it off the stack 
                     } 
                      else {
                  if the node at the top of the stack has untried children
                  push the next untried child onto the stack 
                  else pop the node off the stack 
                  }
                    return false
                  }
                }
                </font>
                </pre>
            </td>
        </tr>
    </table><br />

    <p>
        <font color="#858585">Starting from the root, the only nodes that can be pushed onto the stack are the children
            of the node currently on the top of the stack, and these are only pushed on one child at a time; hence, the
            nodes on the stack at all times describe a valid path in the tree. Nodes are removed from the stack only
            when it is known that they have no goal nodes among their descendents. Therefore, if the root node gets
            removed (making the stack empty), there must have been no goal nodes at all, and no solution to the problem.
            <br /> <br /> When the stack algorithm terminates successfully, the nodes on the stack form (in reverse
            order) a path from the root to a goal node. <br /> <br /> Similarly, when the recursive algorithm finds a
            goal node, the path information is embodied (in reverse order) in the sequence of recursive calls. Thus as
            the recursion unwinds, the path can be recovered one node at a time, by (for instance) printing the node at
            the current level, or storing it in an array. <br /><br /> Here is the recursive backtracking algorithm,
            modified slightly to print (in reverse order) the nodes along the successful path: </font>

    <h3>Keeping backtracking simple</h3>
    <p>
        <font color="#858585">All of these versions of the backtracking algorithm are pretty simple, but when applied to
            a real problem, they can get pretty cluttered up with details. Even determining whether the node is a leaf
            can be complex:<br /><br /> for example, if the path represents a series of moves in a chess endgame
            problem, the leaves are the checkmate and stalemate solutions <br /><br /> To keep the program clean,
            therefore, tests like this should be buried in methods. In a chess game, for example, you could test whether
            a node is a leaf by writing a <strong>
                <font color="black">gameOver method </font>
            </strong> (or you could even call <strong>
                <font color="black">it isLeaf</font>
            </strong> ). This method would encapsulate all the ugly details of figuring out whether any possible moves
            remain. <br /><br /> Notice that the backtracking altorithms require us to keep track, for each node on the
            current path, which of its children have been tried already (so we don't have to try them again). In the
            above code we made this look simple, by just saying <strong>
                <font color="black">for each child c of n</font>
            </strong>. In reality, it may be difficult to figure out what the possible children are, and there may be no
            obvious way to step through them. In chess, for example, a node can represent one arrangement of pieces on a
            chessboard, and each child of that node can represent the arrangement after some piece has made a legal
            move. How do you find these children, and how do you keep track of which ones you've already examined?
            <br /><br> The most straightforward way to keep track of which children of the node have been tried is as
            follows: Upon initial entry to the node (that is, when you first get there from above), make a list of all
            its children. As you try each child, take it off the list. When the list is empty, there are no remaining
            untried children, and you can return "failure." This is a simple approach, but it may require quite a lot of
            additional work.<br> There is an easier way to keep track of which children have been tried, if you can
            define an ordering on the children. If there is an ordering, and you know which child you just tried, you
            can determine which child to try next. <br><br> For example, you might be able to number the <strong>
                <font color="black">children 1 through n</font>
            </strong>, and try them in numerical order. Then, if you have just tried <strong>
                <font color="black">child k</font>
            </strong>, you know that you have already tried children 1 through <strong>
                <font color="black">k-1</font>
            </strong>, and you have not yet tried children <strong>
                <font color="black">k+1</font>
            </strong> through <strong>
                <font color="black">n</font>
            </strong>. Or, if you are trying to color a map with just four colors, you can always try <strong>
                <font color="black">red first, then yellow, then green, then blue.</font>
            </strong> If child yellow fails, you know to try child green next. If you are searching a maze, you can try
            choices in the order left, straight, right <strong>
                <font color="black">(or perhaps north, east, south, west).</font>
            </strong> <br><br> It isn't always easy to find a simple way to order the children of a node, <strong>
                <font color="black"> In the chess game example</font>
            </strong> you might number your pieces (or perhaps the squares of the board) and try them in numerical
            order; <br><br> but in addition each piece may also have several moves, and these must also be ordered. You
            can probably find some way to order the children of a node. If the ordering scheme is simple enough, you
            should use it; but if it is too cumbersome, you are better off keeping a list of untried children. <br>
        </font>

    <h3>Example: Tree Search</h3>
    <p>
        <font color="#858585">For starters, let's do the simplest possible example of backtracking, which is searching
            an actual tree. We will also use the simplest kind of tree, a binary tree. <br><br> A binary tree is a data
            structure composed of nodes. One node is designated as the root node. Each node can reference (point to)
            zero, one, or two other nodes, which are called its children. The children are referred to as the left child
            and/or the right child. All nodes are reachable (by one or more steps) from the root node, and there are no
            cycles. For our purposes, although this is not part of the definition of a binary tree, we will say that a
            node might or might not be a goal node, and will contain its name. The first example in this paper (which we
            repeat here) shows a binary tree. Here's a definition of the BinaryTree class: <br><br></font>

    <h3>What are the children?</h3><br>

    <p>
        <font color="#858585">One of the things that simplifies the above binary tree search is that, at each choice
            point, you can ignore all the previous choices. Previous choices don't give you any information about what
            you should do next; as far as you know, both the left and the right child are possible solutions. In many
            problems, however, you may be able to eliminate children immediately, without recursion. <br /><br />
            Consider, for example, the problem of four-coloring a map. It is a theorem of mathematics that any map on a
            plane, no matter how convoluted the countries are, can be colored with at most four colors, so that no two
            countries that share a border are the same color. <br /><br /> To color a map, you choose a color for the
            first country, then a color for the second country, and so on, until all countries are colored. <br />
            <br /> There are two ways to do this: <br></font>
    </p>

    <ul type="disc">
        <font color="#858585">
            <li>Method 1. Try each of the four possible colors, and recur. When you run out of countries, check whether
                you are at a goal node.</li><br>
            <li>Method 2. Try only those colors that have not already been used for an adjacent country, and recur. If
                and when you run out of countries, you have successfully colored the map.</li>

            Conversely, by waiting to check until a leaf node is reached, exponential growth is practically guaranteed.

    </h3><br>
    <p>
        <font color="#858585">Often our first try at a program doesn't work, and we need to debug it. Debuggers are
            helpful, but sometimes we need to fall back on inserting print statements. There are some simple tricks to
            making effective use of print statements. These tricks can be applied to any program, but are especially
            useful when you are trying to debug recursive routines.</font>
    </p><br>

    <p>
        <font color="#858585"> <strong>
                <font color="black">Trick #1: Indent when you print method entries and exits.</font>
            </strong> <br /><br /> Often, the best debugging technique is to print every method call and return (or at
            least the most important ones). You probably want to print, for each method, what parameters it came in
            with, and what value it leaves with. However, if you just print a long list of these, it's hard to match up
            method exits with their corresponding entries. Indenting to show the level of nesting can help.</font>

    <p>
        <font color="#858585"><strong>
                <font color="black">Trick #2: Use specialized print methods for debugging.</font>
            </strong> <br /><br /> Don't clutter up your actual code more than you must. Also, remember that code
            inserted for debugging purposes can itself contain bugs, or (in the worst case) can affect the results, so
            be very careful with it.</font>

    <h3>Trick #3: Never discard your debugging statements.</h3><br>

    <p>
        <font color="#858585">Writing debugging statements is programming, too. Often it's as much work to debug the
            debugging statements as it is to debug the actual program. Once your program is working, why throw this code
            away? <br /><br /> Obviously, you don't want to print out all this debugging information from a program you
            are ready to submit (or to turn over to your manager). You could comment out your debugging calls, but that
            can be a lot of work. What's more, in the above example, you would have to replace every return(yes(node))
            with return(true), and every return(no(node)) with return false. With all these changes, you might introduce
            new bugs into your program. <br /><br /> The simple solution is to make your debugging statements
            conditional. For example,<br /></font>

        <font color="#858585">The backtracking method is named solvable and returns a boolean. In solvable we shall need
            to check whether we are at a leaf, which in this case means a position from which no further moves are
            possible. This isn't so easy. <br /><br /> Now to the program. The main program will initialize the board,
            and call a recursive backtracking routine to attempt to solve the puzzle. The backtracking routine will
            either succeed and print out a winning path, or it will fail, and the main program will have to print out
            the bad news. <br /><br /> The backtracking method is named solvable and returns a boolean. In solvable we
            shall need to check whether we are at a leaf, which in this case means a position from which no further
            moves are possible. This isn't so easy. <br /><br /> Each possible move will result in a new board position,
            and these new board positions are the children of the current board position. Hence to find the children of
            a node (that is, of a board position), we need only find the possible moves from that node. Remember that it
            is also highly desirable to find an ordering on these possible moves. <br /><br /> Here it is time to stop
            and take thought. To make progress, we must analyze the game to some extent. Probably a number of approaches
            would work, and what follows is based on the way I worked it out. If you were to program this puzzle, you
            might find a different but equally valid approach. <br /><br /> First, notice that if a marble has a move,
            that move is unique: if it can move ahead one square, then it cannot jump. If it can jump, it cannot move
            ahead one square. This suggests that, to find the possible moves, we might assign numbers to the marbles,
            and check each marble in turn. When we have looked at all the marbles, we have looked at all the possible
            moves. This would require having a table to keep track of where each marble is, or else somehow "marking"
            each marble with its number and searching the board each time to find the marble we want. Neither
            alternative is very attractive. <br /><br /> Next, notice that for a given board position, each marble
            occupies a unique space. Hence, instead of talking about moving a particular marble, we can talk about
            moving the marble in a particular space. If a move is possible from a given space, then that must be the
            only move possible from that space, because if the marble in that space has a move, it is unique. There is a
            slight complication because not every space contains a marble, but at least the spaces (unlike the marbles)
            stay in one place.</font>
    </p><br>

    <p>Now we have a simpler ordering of moves to use in our program. Just check, in order, the 2n+1 spaces of the
        board. For each space, either zero or one moves is possible. With this understanding, we can write a boolean
        method canMove(int[] board, int position) which determines whether a move is possible from the given position:
    </p><br>

    <ul type="disc">
        <li>
            <font color="#858585">If the position is empty, no move is possible;</font>
        </li>
        <li>
            <font color="#858585">If the position contains a black marble, the method checks for a move or jump to the
                right;</font>
        </li>
        <li>
            <font color="#858585">If the position contains a white marble, the method checks for a move or jump to the
                left.</font>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        <font color="#858585">We write another method <b>
                <font color="black"> int[] makeMove(int[] oldBoard, int position)</font>
            </b> that will take a board and a position, make a move from that position, and return as its value a new
            board. (We could write this somewhat more efficiently by changing the old board, rather than creating a new
            one, but here we are more concerned with simplicity.) In technical jargon, makeMove is "applicative" rather
            than "mutative." <br /><br /> Along with <b>

                <font color="black">puzzleSolved and printBoard</font>

            written as follows:</font>

                        Notice that the solution is given in reverse order: BLACK starts out on the left and WHITE on
                        the right, as in the last line. I've added line numbers to the actual output in order to
                        emphasize this point. Backtracking always produces its results (sequence of choices) in reverse
                        order; it is up to you, the programmer, to reverse the results again to get them in the correct
                        order.
